#### The Diet Problem: Implemented in AMPL and Python (amplpy)

I set up the necessary model and data files for the diet example in AMPL were under the models directory of the AMPL installation. It should be possible to work from the command line (terminal or Powershell) to execute the example program implemented in: amplpy-diet-example.py. 

Ensure that lines 11 and 16 of the program amplpy-diet-example.py refer to the directories where you have installed AMPL and have place the diet.dat and diet.mod files for the diet problem.

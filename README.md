# Optimizing Nutritional Intake within Budgetary Constraints: A Personal Dietary Linear Programming Approach

##  Methods
Linear Programming Model Formulation:
In this section, I constructed a linear programming model to determine the most cost-effective weekly diet that satisfies my nutritional requirements. The decision variables represented the servings per week of five food items: almonds, brown rice, Greek yogurt, pizza, and tofu vegetables & hash brown. The objective was to minimize the total cost of these items while adhering to nutritional constraints on calories, protein, and essential vitamins and minerals.
Constraints Implementation:
I incorporated constraints to reflect the minimum and maximum nutritional requirements based on current dietary guidelines. These constraints ensured my diet would not exceed sodium limits while meeting my needs for energy, protein, vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium.

## Results
Initial Solution Analysis:
The initial solution to my diet problem highlighted a reliance on a single food item—pizza—due to its cost-effectiveness in meeting the set nutritional parameters. The total cost for my weekly diet plan was calculated to be $143.625.
Dietary Variety Constraints:
Recognizing the importance of dietary variety, I revised the model to include at least one serving of each food item. This adjustment aimed to promote a more balanced nutrient intake, even if it increased the overall cost.
